#### Name ________________________________
  
#### Terminology
  
**1)**  ____ A collection of key-value pairs that associate a key with a value.
  
**2)**  ____ A hierarchical structure that place elements in nodes along branches that originate from a root.
  
**3)**  ____ A tree structure in which each node can have at most two children, and in which a unique path exists from the root to every other node.
  
**4)**  ____ A type of tree in which the key value of each node is less than every key value in its right subtree, and greater than every key value in its left subtree.
  
**5)**  ____ A type of binary tree in which the height of each node’s subtrees differs by no more than one.
  
**6)**  ____ A two-dimensional structure that corresponds to a row-column table of entries of a specified data type.
  
**7)**  ____ A binary tree in which all of the leaves are on the same level and every non-leaf node has exactly two children
  
**8)**  ____ A binary tree that is either full or full through the next-to-last level, with the leaves on the last level as far to the left as possible
  
**9)**  ____ A complete binary tree in which each node has a value stored in it that is greater than or equal to the value in each of its children.
  
**10)**  ____ Nodes in a binary tree that have only NULL children
  
**11)**  ____ A node in a binary tree that does not have a parent
  
**12)**  ____ A data structure that consists of a set of nodes and a set of edges that relate the nodes to each other
  
**13)**  ____ A graph in which each edge is directed from one vertex to another (or the same) vertex
  
**14)**  ____ A graph in which every vertex is directly connected to every other vertex
  
**15)**  ____ A graph in which each edge carries a value
  
**16)**  ____ This occurs when 2 different identifiers are hashed into the same location
  
**17)**  ____ A method for finding the shortest path from one vertex to another in a weighted digraph
  
**18)**  ____ A graph traversal method that visits the nodes from a starting vertex “level by level”
  
**19)**  ____ Extreme change in resulting value by simply changing a single bit.
  
**20)**  As the ________ approaches 1, the number of collisions increases in a hash table.
