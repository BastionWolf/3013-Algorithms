## Final - Study Guide

### Topics Tested On

### Other Topics

These topics have not been on any test, and have higher probability of being on the final:

- Graph Representations
- Graph Traversals
- AVL Trees
- Huffman Codes
- Backtracking (explain concept and why recursion fits this so well).
- Extra Credit on Exam: Explain (very well) why Kruskels cannot benefit from the same speedup as Prims using a Fibonocci heap to choose edges.


Implenting code is not the goal of the exam. If there is any implementation questions, it will be solving something small and "doable". For example you will not be asked to "Write a Huffman Code Class". 

You will be asked to do similar stuff like on test 3, follow / explain an algorith. 
There might be some small snippets you will have to write, but nothing too major. 

I will post some more small code writing related questions in a while, but this should get you started. If nothing show up before 10:00 pm then this is finalized.
