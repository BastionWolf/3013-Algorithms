## Ferry Loading - Problems 1-3
#### Due: 04-27-2020 (Monday @ 11:59 p.m.)

- This is a set of problems that all have the same basic idea, but solved using different methods. 
- It also just so happens that Ferry Loading I,II,III go from hardest to easiest.
- I thought this would make a good set of problems to see similar (well at least problem II and III) problems with different solution paradigms.

**First Version:**
- Paradigm: Dynamic Programming
- Problem [10261](./FerryLoading/10261/10261.pdf)
- Ferry Loading: A dynamic programming problem similar to the knapsack problem. 
- Discussion on page 107 here: https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/cp3.pdf
- [Example Knapsack](https://github.com/luisfcofv/competitive-programming-book/blob/master/ch3/ch3_07_UVa10130.cpp)
- I would try this problem last.

**Second Version**
- Paradigm: Greedy
- Problem [10440](./FerryLoading/10440/10440.pdf)
- Ferry Loading II : A greedy approach to ferryiing cars across a river.
- Discussion on page 89 here: https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/cp3.pdf
- No example code
- I would try this second.

**Third Version**
- Paradigm: None really
  - It simply uses an stl queue or deque
- Problem [10901](./FerryLoading/10901/10901.pdf)
- Ferry Loading III : A queue based approach to solving this problem.
- Mentioned on page 42 here: https://cs.msutexas.edu/~griffin/cp3.pdf
- No example code
- I would try this first.
