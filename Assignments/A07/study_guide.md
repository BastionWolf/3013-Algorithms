- Place the values from figure one, into an array based implementation of a Binary Tree.

- Perform the following traversals on the binary tree in figure 1:
    - PreOrder traversal
    - InOrder traversal
    - PostOrder traversal
    - LevelOrder traversal.

- Using the tree in figure 1, in what order would the values be output if:
    - Using a PostOrder traversal, you push all values onto a stack, then pop them off 1 at a time and output the value.
    - Using a PreOrder traversal, you enqueue all of the values, then dequeue them 1 at a time and output the value.

- Again, using the tree in figure 1, re-arrange the values so that is represents a complete BST and draw the resulting tree.

- Write a recursive function to perform:
    - PreOrder traversal
    - InOrder traversal
    - PostOrder traversal

- Write a recursive function to find a key value in a BST.

- Given a sequence of numbers: **11, 6, 8, 19, 4, 10, 5, 17, 43, 49, 31**
    - Insert them into a Binary Search Tree
    - Insert them into a Max Heap
    - Insert them into a Min Heap
    - Insert them into an Avl Tree

- Label the balance factor for each node for the tree at the top of the page.

Describe:

- The differences between a BST and AVL tree. Know the differences in implementation and performance (costs for insertion, searching, and deletion). Do we implement one or both using arrays or pointers?

- What are MIN and MAX Heaps used for? What are the costs for insertion and removal. Why does heapify have a better performance then inserting one value at a time? Implement a heap using pointers or arrays?
