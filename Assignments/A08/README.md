## Test 3 - Graph Algorithms

### Heuristic

A **heuristic** is any approach to problem solving or self-discovery that employs a practical method that is not guaranteed to be optimal, perfect or rational, but which is nevertheless sufficient for reaching an immediate, short-term goal <sup> [Wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heuristic) </sup>.

- Read and try to understand the following algorithms and the heuristics they employ. 
- Be able to apply each algorithm and discuss its nuances and run times.

- [Prims](../../Lectures/L08/README.md)
- [Kruskels](../../Lectures/L08/README.md)
- [Dijkstra's](../../Lectures/L10/demo-dijkstra.ppt)
- [A-Star](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html) 
  - In this article just concentrate on the algorithms and heuristics they employ. 



## Q1 

Is there any distance in the run times for Prims and Kruskels?
